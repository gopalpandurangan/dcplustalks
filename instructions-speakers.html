    <h1>Instructions for speakers</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Practical instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Connect early.</strong>
          Please join the Zoom meeting at least <strong>30 minutes</strong> before the scheduled start time.
          We use this time to test audio, video, screen sharing, and to answer any last-minute questions.
          Once everything is working, you are welcome to step away and return just before the talk starts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slides in advance.</strong>
          Please send us your slides a few days before the talk so we can post them on the website
          and have a backup copy in case of technical problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Talk length.</strong>
          A typical DS talk is about <strong>50 minutes</strong>, followed by questions.
          If you have additional technical material that goes beyond this, we can:
          Take questions, let attendees leave if they wish, and then continue with a more technical “after-session.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pointer.</strong>
          Please use your mouse cursor as a “laser pointer” when highlighting parts of your slides.
          This tends to be more visible on camera than a hardware laser pointer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recommended equipment</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure a smooth online experience for both you and the audience, we recommend the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Computer.</strong>
          A reasonably recent laptop or desktop. Before the talk, close heavy applications so that your CPU load
          is comfortably below 50% while running Zoom.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network.</strong>
          A <strong>wired</strong> internet connection is strongly preferred over Wi-Fi, as it typically provides
          lower latency and fewer dropouts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audio.</strong>
          A good <strong>headset with a built-in microphone</strong> (USB or 3.5mm) is ideal.
          It greatly improves sound quality and reduces echo compared to using laptop speakers and a built-in mic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optional: second screen.</strong>
          If you have a second monitor, consider extending your display and putting the Zoom window there.
          This allows you to see the audience while presenting, making the experience more natural and
          making it easier to spot raised hands or chat messages.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>General advice for speakers</h2>
      <p>
        One of the main goals of DS is to make research in theoretical computer science widely accessible.
        With that in mind, here are some suggestions for preparing your talk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide a gentle introduction.</strong>
          Start with a broad overview of the area and give a sense of the kinds of problems people study there.
          Assume a general TCS background rather than deep expertise in your subfield.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Highlight open problems.</strong>
          When appropriate, mention key open questions and where your work fits in that landscape.
          This helps the audience understand the broader impact of the results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mind the pace and technical density.</strong>
          The online format is less forgiving of very fast or extremely technical talks.
          Err on the side of going slightly slower and focusing on the main ideas rather than all details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use a live audience if available.</strong>
          If you are presenting from a seminar room or office with a few people present,
          it can help you gauge pacing and engagement, which is sometimes harder to do over video.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slide design.</strong>
          Use sufficiently large fonts and clear diagrams.
          Remember that some viewers may be watching on laptops, tablets, or projectors with limited resolution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encourage questions.</strong>
          Could you let the audience know whether you prefer questions during the talk or at the end?
          The moderator will help manage questions via audio and chat to keep the discussion smooth.
        </li>
      </ul>
