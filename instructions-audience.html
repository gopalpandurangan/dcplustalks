      <h2>Tuning in</h2>
      <p>There are two main ways to follow a DS talk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Join the live session.</strong>
          You can participate in the interactive Zoom meeting using a computer or a mobile device
          (laptop, tablet, or smartphone). If you want to be seen and heard, you’ll need a camera
          and a microphone. To keep the meeting secure, we ask attendees to reserve a “seat” in
          advance using the registration form on the <a href="reserve-seat.html">seat reservation</a> page.
          Connection details for the Zoom meeting are emailed to registered participants before the talk.
          Attendance is free; a free Zoom account is sufficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watch the recording later.</strong>
          If you cannot join live, you can watch the recording after the talk on our
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.
          Recordings are typically posted shortly after the talk finishes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Joining the live Zoom talk</h2>

      <h3>Before the talk</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MyCS+ talks are hosted via <strong>Zoom</strong>. For security reasons,
          attendees need to join using a Zoom account (a free account is fine).
        </li>
        <li>
          When a new talk is announced (on the website and via email), please register
          using the <a href="reserve-seat.html">online seat reservation form</a>.
          The number of seats is usually not a limiting factor, but we only send
          the Zoom meeting link by email to registered participants.
          You are very welcome to join as an individual; you do not need to be part of a group.
        </li>
        <li>
          We typically send the Zoom link about 15 minutes before the talk begins.
          Please connect at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time so that
          any technical issues can be resolved without interrupting the speaker.
        </li>
        <li>
          The recommended way to join is using the Zoom desktop or mobile app.
          Joining from a browser may work, but the app usually provides a more stable experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are joining as an individual from a shared space, please use headphones.
          This helps prevent echo and feedback when you unmute to ask questions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>During the talk</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep your microphone muted</strong> while the speaker is presenting,
          unless you are asking a question. This keeps background noise to a minimum.
          If you forget, the organizers may mute your microphone for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking questions.</strong> We strongly encourage questions—this helps
          both the audience and the speaker.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The simplest option is to unmute and ask your question verbally when
              there is a natural pause, or when invited by the moderator.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you prefer not to speak, you can use the Zoom chat. You can either
              type your question in full, or write something like “??”. The moderator
              will keep an eye on the chat and interrupt the speaker at an appropriate moment.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are watching together with a group using a single Zoom connection,
          consider using a simple external or wireless microphone for the room. This can
          make it easier for the speaker and other attendees to hear questions clearly.
        </li>
