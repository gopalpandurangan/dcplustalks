    <h1>Staying informed</h1>

    <p>
      We use several channels to share information about upcoming DS talks, schedule changes,
      and other news. 
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Calendar</h2>
      <p>
        The easiest way to keep track of talks is to subscribe to our
        <strong>online calendar</strong>. All confirmed talks are added with titles, speakers,
        dates, times, and connection details.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can view the calendar in your browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also subscribe to it from most calendar applications
          (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.) using the provided URL.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Replace # with the share link to your calendar -->
      <p>
        <a class="primary-btn" href="#">Open the DS calendar</a>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mailing list</h2>
      <p>
        We maintain a low-volume <strong>mailing list</strong> for announcements.
        Before each talk, we send out an email with the title, abstract, and connection information.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Typically, you will receive one email per talk, plus occasional general announcements.</li>
        <li>You can unsubscribe at any time via a link at the bottom of every message.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Replace # with your mailing list subscription link -->
      <p>
        <a href="#">Subscribe to the announcement list</a>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Announcement blog and RSS</h2>
      <p>
        For those who prefer RSS or like to browse announcements in one place, we keep an
        <strong>announcement blog</strong> where each talk has its own post. This is a good way
        to scroll through past and upcoming talks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every talk is announced with title, speaker, abstract, and basic logistics.</li>
        <li>If you use an RSS reader, you can subscribe to the blog’s RSS feed and receive
            new posts automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Replace # with your blog and RSS URLs -->
      <p>
        <a href="#">Visit the announcement blog</a> ·
        <a href="#">RSS feed</a>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Social updates</h2>
      <p>
        We also post brief announcements of new talks and other news on our social accounts.
        Follow us there if that is your preferred way to stay up to date.
      </p>
      <!-- Replace # and handle with your actual social links/handles -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bluesky:</strong> <a href="#">@mycsplus.bsky.social</a>
        </li>
        <!-- Add others if you have them, e.g. X/Twitter, Mastodon, etc. -->
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>YouTube and RSS</h2>
      <p>
        Most talks are recorded and made available on our
        <strong>YouTube channel</strong>. If you subscribe there, you will be notified when
        new recordings are posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also follow the channel via an <strong>RSS feed</strong>, which is handy if you
        prefer to use a feed reader rather than the YouTube interface.
      </p>
